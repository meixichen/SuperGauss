Description: R wrapper to a C++ library for linear algebra with positive-
    definite Toeplitz matrices. In particular, a "superfast" O(n log^2 n) solver
    for Toeplitz systems is provided, whereas the more common Levinson algorithm for
    such systems is O(n^2). The implementation uses Fast Fourier Transforms provided
    by the fftw library. In addition to the solver, the package provides superfast
    algorithms for matrix-vector multiplication and determinants. The C++ code is
    provided as a header-only library for low-level usage outside of R.
