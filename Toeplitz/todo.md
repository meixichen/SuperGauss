### TODO

0. **Package vignette** *(Yun)*.  This is basically a quick tutorial for the package and what it can do.  Suggestion: fBM + stochastic drift.  Simulate data, use Newton-Raphson to recover parameters, simulate posterior dstr of drift using Dietrich algorithm.  The first section should be instructions on obtaining `fftw`.  Write this using `Rmarkdown` as per the following instructions: <http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/vignettes.html>
0. **Roxygen documentation** *(Martin)*.  Write the **R** function documentation and make sure it is `devtools`-compatible.
0. **Toeplitz class documentation** *(Yun & Martin)*.  Set up `Toeplitz-Class.R` to do this *(Martin)*.  Then documentation is exactly like regular functions *(Yun)*.
0. **Header-only library** *(Yun & Martin)*.  Convert all **C++** code to `.h` files *(Yun)*.  Put these in `inst/include/` and make sure the **R** wrappers know where to look *(Martin)*. 
0. **Set up as R package** *(Yun)*.  `SuperGauss`` should be the name of the **R** package.  Merge the Durbin-Levinson functions back in as they are required for some variants of `rSnorm`, and for Cholesky decomposition in general.  Use `.Rbuildignore` and `.gitignore` to ignore things that shouldn't be in the **R** package (such as `setup.R`) and the Git repo (such as `.o`, `.dll`, `.Rhistory`), respectively.  Note that **R** by default doesn't include anything in folders named `old` or any file starting with ".".
0. **More formal testing** *(Yun)*.  Set up some tests for all the functions using the `testthat` package as per the following instructions: <http://http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html>.  This completely automates the test procedure, such that anytime something in the package or **C++** code gets modified, or if we want to see if things work on linux or Mac, we can essentially do this with a single line of code.
