Description: R wrapper to a C++ library for linear algebra with positive-definite Toeplitz matrices.  In particular, a "superfast" O(n log^2 n) solver for Toeplitz systems is provided, whereas the more common Levinson algorithm for such systems is O(n^2).  The implementation using Fast Fourier Transforms provided by the fftw library.  In addition to solver, the package provides superfast algorithms for matrix-vector multiplication and determinants.  The C++ code is provided as a header-only library for low-level usage outside of R.
