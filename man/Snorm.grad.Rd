\title{Gradient of a Stationary Gaussian Log-Likelihood}
\usage{
Snorm.grad(X, mean, acf, dmean, dacf, Toep, debug = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{\code{n x d} matrix, d i.i.d. vector follows N(mean, Variance).}

\item{mean}{\code{n} vector or matrix.}

\item{acf}{\code{n} vector or matrix, first column of variance matrix, or a Toeplitz class initialized by acf}

\item{dmean}{\code{n x p} matrix, where \code{p} is the number of parameters, each column is the partial derivative of mean.}

\item{dacf}{\code{n x p} matrix, each column is the partial deruvative of acf.}
}
\value{
The gradient of the log-likelihood.
}
\description{
Efficient evaluation of log-likelihood gradient for stationary Gaussian data.
}
\note{
package "SuperGauss" is required
